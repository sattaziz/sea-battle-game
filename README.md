# sea-battle-game
Simple sea battle game for pve

This game created for testing me own abilities of how to use classes properly. Furthermore, this project was useful for improving my logical thinking:
- creating overall plan and understanding the rules of the game;
- dividing the game into units to construct classes;
- connecting classes.
